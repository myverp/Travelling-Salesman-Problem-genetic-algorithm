# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver using Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a solution to the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using a Genetic Algorithm. The algorithm evolves a population of candidate solutions to minimize the total travel distance between cities, aiming to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Evolve a population to find the optimal or near-optimal solution to the TSP.
- **Selection**: Tournament selection method for choosing parents.
- **Crossover**: Order crossover (OX) technique to produce offspring.
- **Mutation**: Swap mutation to introduce randomness.
- **Fitness Calculation**: Based on the total travel distance of the route.
- **Visualization**: Plots the best-found route using Matplotlib.
